How to contribute
===
We're in need of new challenges to help make us a great resource for those looking to learn more about creating and testing web applications. Though, the majority of our current challenges are in Ruby, we're striving to become more language agnostic. Currently, we're looking for new challenges in Python, Ruby, and JS including client-side frameworks like Backbone & AngularJS.

__Submitting your challenge__
- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Fork the [Challenge Skeleton](https://github.com/paircolumbus/ChallengeSkeleton) on GitHub & follow it's format
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
- Submit a pull request to the repository in the Engineers organization
- We'll review it and close the pull request! Thanks :)
