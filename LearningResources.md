###Install :(
- Mac Users  
  - [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/download/)  
  - [Install RVM](http://rvm.io/)

__Note:__ Installing software is dreaded even by seasoned developers, if you have any problems please ask for help.  

###Learn! :)
  [Typing.io](https://typing.io/) - I'd highly recommend becoming a touch typer if you're not already. Try out the Ruby track and aim for at least 40wpm.

  [Code School](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) -> Try Git - What's Git? It's probably one of the most important tools you'll ever use as a software engineer. If you're not hip, then start with this tutorial.

  [Regex one: tutorial](http://regexone.com/) - At some point, we'll do a little work with regular expressions. I'd highly encourage this tutorial for newbies.

  [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) -> Pick your poison - HTML/CSS, Javascript, JQuery & Ruby tracks are all recommended.

  [CLI the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) -> Learn Bash - At some point, we're going to be using the command line quite a bit to handle things like basic navigation, source control, bundling dependencies, starting up web servers, and deploying our apps for the world to see! But before we can do that, we'll need to be familiar with the basics.

  __Read the docs__ -> [Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/) / [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) - It may seem a bit taxing at times, but it's always good to read through key parts of the documentation a few times before tackling an application. 

  > Ruby: Read up on the [String](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/String.html), [Array](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html), [Hash](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html), [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html) & [Integer](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Integer.html) methods.

  > Rails: The [_Getting Started Guide_](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) is a great place for familiarizing yourself with core components like partials, helpers, migrations, and generators.

  __NOTE:__ There's no expectation that you learn this stuff overnight, but instead that you review and start familiaring yourself with key concepts. Bring your questions to our first meetup!
