#Tutoring Resources

Here are some resources to prepare yourself for learning and building in Ruby on Rails. 

__Beginner__ - Rusty or new to web development, limited knowledge of programming languages & related tools

__Intermediate__ - Very familiar with Ruby, JS, MacOS/Linux, Shell, Git & your text editor of choice.  

- - -

##Intermediate
- Review the [Enumerable Methods](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html)
- Create a script that accepts user input via the command line
- It should print a menu to screen and give player multiple options (i.e. start, play again, view help, exit, etc)
- It should be object oriented and not expose important functionality
- It should use the MVC pattern. Consider prints & puts as a part of your view.

##Beginner
  [Typing.io](https://typing.io/) - I'd highly recommend becoming a touch typer if you're not already. Try out the Ruby track and aim for at least 40wpm.

  [Perfect Workflow for Sublime Text](http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-2) - We're going to use Sublime Text 2 because it should make pairing more bearable for our Vim and non-Vim users. It's also free and available for Mac and PC. Go ahead & install it! Bring any questions, you might have. 

  [Regex one: tutorial](http://regexone.com/) - At some point, we'll do a little work with regular expressions. I'd highly encourage this tutorial for newbies.

  [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) -> HTML/CSS, Javascript, JQuery & Ruby - On our first day, we're going to take a crack at a HTML/CSS drill with possibly a little JQuery, JS & Rails tossed in for good measure.

  [CLI the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/) -> Learn Bash - At some point, we're going to be using the command line quite a bit to handle things like basic navigation, source control, bundling dependencies, starting up web servers, and deploying our apps for the world to see! But before we can do that, we'll need to be familiar with the basics.

  [Code School](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) -> Try Git - What's Git? It's probably one of the most important tools you'll ever use as a software engineer. If you're not hip, then start with this tutorial.

  __Read the docs__ -> [Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/) / [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) - It may seem a bit taxing at times, but it's always good to read through key parts of the documentation a few times before tackling an application. 

  > Ruby: Read up on the [String](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/String.html), [Array](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Array.html), [Hash](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html), [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerable.html) & [Integer](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Integer.html) methods.

  > Rails: The [_Getting Started Guide_](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) is a great place for familiarizing yourself with core components like partials, helpers, migrations, and generators.

  __NOTE:__ There's no expectation that you learn this stuff overnight, but instead that you review and start familiaring yourself with key concepts. Bring your questions to our first meetup!
