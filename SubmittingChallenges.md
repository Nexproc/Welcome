#How to submit challenges via GitHub
__NOTE:__ Don't run `git push origin master` please :) 

1. [Download & Install Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics)
  - 'git clone' the drill you want to work on.
  - Write your code

2. [Checking Stats & Commiting](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics)
  - check your 'git status'
  - 'git add'
  - 'git commit'

3. Branching
  - create a new 'git branch'
  - 'git checkout' that branch

4. [Using Remotes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/remote-repositories)
  - Push your changes up to the remote, 'git push origin [branch-name]'

5. Documentation
  - http://git-scm.com/documentation

If any of this feels overwhelming, try out the CodeSchool course, [Try Git](https://github.com/columbustutoringgroup/Welcome). It's listed under Welcome->'Resources'. We'll cover the rest later.
