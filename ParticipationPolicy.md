#Participation Policy

There are a number of people on the waiting list and I feel its important that we have a rather strict participation policy in order to be fair to them.

In order to remain a member of the tutoring group, there will be an expectation that you complete your weekly challenges. Two missed challenges will result in dismissal from the meeting list & semi-monthly meetings. You will be however able to follow along with challenges on GitHub at your own pace.
