#Participation Policy

There are a number of people on the waiting list and I feel its important that we have a rather strict participation policy in order to be fair to them. In order to remain a member of the tutoring group, there will be the following expectations: 

- Complete weekly challenges 
- Attend bimonthly sessions (please contact me if you won't be able to attend)
- Communicate professionally & responsibly with your pairing partner

Not meeting the above expectations will result in dismissal from the Engineers email list, accountability check-ins & semi-monthly meetings. You will be however able to follow along with the challenges on GitHub at your own pace as a part of our Juniors group & reapply by submitting your name to the [waiting list](https://docs.google.com/a/goodproduce.net/forms/d/11WzmAGErqLTQ6NAwtBOTVl_BOlkXdj3L-8tbzBNGb9s/viewform).
